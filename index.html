                    Reading can have a major impact on our health, our personality, our ability to relate to others, the
                    level of compassion we feel, our general knowledge, and last but definitely not least, on the way
                    our society looks and works. Needless to say, reading is a huge part of our lives and it should be
                    treated as such.
